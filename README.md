It's a config file of tmux which has to be loaded to tmux.conf

## Installation
1. Install tmux
    - Mac users:
        ```brew install tmux```
    - Unix users:
        ```sudo apt-get install tmux```

2. Copy milktea to a folder e.g. ~/tmux_themes/

3. Edit .tmux.conf in your home folder (if it doesn't exist, create one)

4. Add ```if-shell "test -f tmux_themes/milktea" "source tmux_themes/milktea"``` at the end of the file. (tmux_themes can be any folder where milktea is).

5. In the bash, run ```tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf ``` to reload the tmux configuration

Ok, done. Now you have a stylish tmux theme! Enjoy it.
